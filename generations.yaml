    description: "The first-generation Vauxhall/Opel Insignia replaced the Vectra as the brand's mid-size offering, representing a significant step upmarket in terms of design, technology, and perceived quality. Built on General Motors' Epsilon II platform, the Insignia was available in sedan (saloon), hatchback (fastback), and estate (Sports Tourer) body styles, with the distinctive appearance winning European Car of the Year honors in 2009. The exterior featured flowing, aerodynamic lines with a coup√©-like silhouette even on four-door variants, contributing to a class-leading drag coefficient of 0.27. Engine options varied extensively depending on market and model year, including petrol units ranging from 1.4 to 2.8-liter displacement and diesel options from 1.6 to 2.0-liters, with power outputs spanning from 110 to 325 horsepower in the high-performance OPC/VXR variants. Transmission choices included six-speed manual, six-speed automatic, and later six-speed automated manual options, with front-wheel drive standard and all-wheel drive (marketed as Adaptive 4x4) available on higher-powered variants. The interior represented a significant advance over the Vectra, featuring a driver-oriented cockpit with a 'wraparound' dashboard design, higher quality materials, and advanced technology including an available 8-inch touchscreen infotainment system, adaptive cruise control, and the sophisticated FlexRide adaptive chassis system with three driving modes adjusting damping, steering, and throttle response. A substantial facelift in 2013 (sometimes referred to as Insignia B in some markets) brought updated styling, enhanced technology, and improved efficiency, helping to maintain competitiveness in the shrinking mid-size segment increasingly challenged by the rise of crossovers and SUVs. The first-generation Insignia proved a successful model for Vauxhall/Opel, elevating the brand's image with its combination of style, technology, and refinement, though facing the same market headwinds affecting all traditional sedans as consumer preferences shifted toward higher-riding vehicles."

    description: "The second-generation Vauxhall/Opel Insignia, marketed as the Insignia Grand Sport (hatchback), Insignia Sports Tourer (estate), and Insignia Country Tourer (raised estate with SUV styling cues), represented the last model developed under General Motors ownership before PSA Group (later Stellantis) acquired Vauxhall/Opel. Built on GM's E2XX platform and sharing components with the North American Buick Regal, the new Insignia grew significantly in length and wheelbase while being up to 175 kg (386 lbs) lighter than its predecessor thanks to more extensive use of high-strength steel and other weight-saving measures. The exterior design evolved with more taut, sculptural surfaces, a lower, wider stance, and a longer, more elegant silhouette emphasizing the increased dimensions. Engine options at launch included 1.5 and 2.0-liter turbocharged petrol units and 1.6 and 2.0-liter diesel engines, with power outputs ranging from 110 to 260 horsepower, though the lineup has evolved following the transition to PSA/Stellantis ownership to include more PSA-sourced powertrains. Transmission choices initially included six-speed manual, six-speed automatic, and eight-speed automatic options, with front-wheel drive standard and all-wheel drive with torque vectoring available on high-end models. The interior featured a more horizontal dashboard design with reduced button count, a standard 7-inch or optional 8-inch touchscreen infotainment system, and enhanced materials throughout. Technology advanced significantly with new features including a head-up display, adaptive LED matrix headlights (IntelliLux), and enhanced driver assistance systems including adaptive cruise control and automated emergency braking. Following PSA's acquisition, the Insignia received updates to align with the new corporate direction, though remaining on its GM-developed platform. The second-generation Insignia continued the model's positioning as a value-oriented alternative to premium mid-size offerings, providing generous space, equipment, and refinement at competitive price points, though facing the ongoing challenge of competing in a segment with declining popularity as buyers increasingly favor SUVs and crossovers."
